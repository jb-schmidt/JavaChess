# JavaChess
Java based Chess game, AI, logic and graphics

Just an experiment to see how much I can code without any outside aid (except rules of chess if I forget!)
1. Starting with object creation, inheritance of pieces, game board etc.
2. Logic of movement
3. Graphical representation of movement
4. AI logic
